fitness challenge:

What causes the header to not get jquery styles?
    1- jquery mobile still trying to handle paging
    2- $.mobilechangepage was called before view was created (callback didn't finish)


todo:
challenge view: showing same challenge every time
                show leaderboard
update challenge progress
update activities
cron job?
accept/decline invitation - error?
return from fitbit auth - cant read login info?

auto update collections when changed:
invitations
challenges

add back button

use stackmob login system
fix ensure login to handle redirect to login and back to destination
